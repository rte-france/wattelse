# APIs

Some services are used by several applications/users at the same time. To optimize resource use, these services are implemented in the form of APIs.

## APIs description

Available APIs:

- [embedding](embedding): uses a SentenceTransformer model to transform text into embeddings
- [vllm](vllm): loads a local LLM and starts an OpenAI API like endpoint
- [rag_orchestrator](rag_orchestrator): used for WattElse DOC, handles multiple RAG instances and routes queries to the appropriate RAG instance
- [openai](openai): (client only) provides a simple interface to interact with the OpenAI APIs

## Start an API

To launch an API, go to the specific API folder and run the `start.py` script. For example:

```bash
cd wattelse/api/embedding
python start.py
```

The API will be launched with the default configuration file `config/default_config.toml`.

It is possible to launch multiple `embedding` or `vllm` APIs in parallel with different configurations. To do so, create a new configuration file in the `config` folder and run the `start.py` script with the correct environment variable set:

- `EMBEDDING_API_CONFIG_FILE`: path to the configuration file to use for the `embedding` API
- `VLLM_API_CONFIG_FILE`: path to the configuration file to use for the `vllm` API

For example:

```bash
# Terminal 1: embedding API with default config
cd wattelse/api/embedding
python start.py

# Terminal 2: embedding API with custom config
cd wattelse/api/embedding
EMBEDDING_API_CONFIG_FILE=config/custom_config.toml python start.py
```

## Stop an API

If the API is running in your current terminal, you can stop it by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

To stop an API that is running in the background, run the `stop.py` script:

```bash
python stop.py
```

## Security and authentication

The embeddings and RAG orchestrator APIs have been secured using different ways

- **HTTPS protocol**: the embedding and RAG orchestrator APIs are using the HTTPS protocol
  - for those APIs, the `start.py` script includes parameters pointing to the certificate and key files required for the HTTPS protocol
  - note that at this stage the certificate has not been issued using a trusted CA (certificate authority).
    Therefore, it may be required in some clients to disable certificate verification. For example using Python, this is done using the following parameter: `requests.post(..., verify=False)`
- **token authentication**: applications using those APIs must authenticate using a _token_.
  - The token is generated by the API on the basis of credentials (_client_id_, _client_secret_) provided by the client app.
  - Any new application that wants to use the APIs shall apply for credentials
  - In practice, from the administrator points of view, a credential for an application contains the following elements
    - `client_id`: identifier of the application using the APIs
    - `client_secret`: application password used to generate authentication tokens
    - `scopes`: so far, one the value `admin`, `full_access`, `restricted_access`. This allows to define to which API a third-party API can connect. It is set by the administrators
    - `authorized_groups`: a list of group names the application can access to for the RAG APIs. This is set by the administrators.
  * Depending on its credentials, a third-party application can access to the full set of the APIs or only a subset, sometimes restricted to specific groups.

Credentials are stored in a client registry (configurable path).

Before calling a restricted API, a client application must authenticate using the `/token` endpoint with its credentials.
